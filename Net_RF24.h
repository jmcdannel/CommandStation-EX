 * nRF24 default mode of operation:
 *   Channel: 108
 *   Bit rate: 2MHz
 *   CRC: 16-bit
 *   Power Level: High
 *
 * The node number is used as the first byte of the nRF24's 5-byte address
 * field. Number 255 is treated as a multicast address.  All stations listen on
 * their own address and on the multicast address.
 *
 * The nRF24 device receives and acknowledges data packets autonomously.
 * Therefore, this driver just needs to detect when a packet is received and
 * read and process its contents.  The time to read the packet is under 200us
 * typically.
 *
 * The nRF24 is also capable of autonomously sending packets, processing
 * acknowledgements, and generating retries.  The driver writes the packet to
 * the device and then waits for notification of completion (success, or retries
 * exceeded) through the device's registers.  Similarly, the time to write a
 * packet is under 200us and, if we don't wait for the completion, we can allow
 * the processor to do other things while the transmission is in progress.
 * A write with ack can complete in under 600us, plus the time of turning the
 * receiver off and on.
 *
 * Usage:
 *  Net_RF24 *rf24Driver = new Net_RF24(48, 49);
 *  Network<Net_RF24>::create(4000, NUMREMOTEPINS(rpins), 1, rpins, rf24Driver);
 * 
 * The nRF24 device has to be connected to the hardware MISO, MOSI, SCK and CS pins of the 
 * microcontroller; in addition, the CE and CSN pins on the nRF24 are connected to 
 * two pins (e.g. 48 and 49 above).
