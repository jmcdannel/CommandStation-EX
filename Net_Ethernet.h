/*
 * Ethernet (W5100,W5200,W5500) default mode of operation:
 *
 * All transmissions are sent with MAC address allOnes, i.e.
 * as a broadcast.  Regular sensor state updates are broadcast anyway, 
 * and other write/writeAnalogue command packets are relatively 
 * infrequent.
 *
 * Usage:
 *  Net_Ethernet *etherDriver = new Net_Ethernet(10);
 *  Network<Net_Ethernet>::create(4000, NUMREMOTEPINS(rpins), 1, rpins, etherDriver);
 * 
 * The W5x00 device has to be connected to the hardware MISO, MOSI, SCK and CS pins of the 
 * microcontroller.  The CS pin is specified in the command above (e.g. 10).
 * For details of the Network class configuration, see IO_Network.h.
