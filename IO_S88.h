/*
 * The S88 Bus is essentially a shift register consisting of one or more
 * S88 modules, connected one to another in one long chain.  The register
 * is read by the following steps:
 *   1) The LOAD/PS line goes to HIGH, then the CLK line is pulsed HIGH.  This
 * tells the registers to acquire data from the latched parallel inputs. 2) With
 * LOAD/PS still high, the RESET signal is pulsed HIGH, which clears the
 * parallel input upstream latches. 3) With LOAD/PS LOW, the shift is performed
 * by pulsing the CLK line high.  On each pulse, the data in the shift register
 * is presented, bit by bit, to the DATA-IN line.
 *
 * Example configuration in mySetup.cpp:
 *    #include "IO_S88.h"
 *    void mySetup() {
 *      S88bus::create(2500, 16, 40,41,42,43, 10);
 *    }
 *
 * This creates an S88 bus instance with 16 inputs (VPINs 2500-2515).
 * The LOAD pin is 40, RESET is 41, CLK is 42 and DATA is 43.  These four pins
 * must be local GPIO pins (not on an I/O expander).
 * The last parameter (bitTime=10) means that at least 10us is allowed for
 * reading each bit in the shift register.
 *
 * Depending on the S88 modules being used and the cabling, the timing of the
 * interface may have to be adjusted.  This is done by the bit time parameter.
 * The original S88 concept was based on 4014 shift register devices, which are
 * easily capable of moderate speed transfers and would cope with a bit time
 * around 2us.  However, commercial S88 devices appear to be extremely slow in
 * comparison and may need the order of tens or hundreds of microseconds.  The
 * symptom of a bit time that is too small is that, when you activate one input to
 * the S88 module, the command station sees something other than the correct
 * activation; e.g. no activations, multiple activations, the wrong pin
 * activating etc.
 *
 * _acquireCycleTime determines the minimum time between successive acquire
 * cycles of the inputs on the S88 bus.  Bear in mind that the Sensor code
 * includes anti-bounce logic which means that fleeting state changes may be
 * ignored, so reducing the acquireCycleTime may not have the desired effect.
 * Also, if the combination of bit time and number of pins is large, the
 * specified cycle time may not be achieved.
