/*
 * ENC28J60 default mode of operation:
 *
 * The node number is used as the last byte of the MAC address
 * field, purely so that the MAC address is unique for each distinct 
 * node number.  The ENC28J60 driver doesn't implement ARP cache, 
 * since it would take up a minimum of 11 bytes per node and, with
 * up to 255 nodes, this would take a significant part of the RAM.
 * Instead, all transmissions are sent with MAC address allOnes, i.e.
 * as a broadcast.  Regular sensor state updates are broadcast anyway, 
 * and other write/writeAnalogue command packets are relatively 
 * infrequent.
 *
 * Usage:
 *  DCCNetDriver driver = new ENC28J60Driver(10);
 * 
 * The ENC28J60 device has to be connected to the hardware MISO, MOSI, SCK and CS pins of the 
 * microcontroller.  The CS pin is specified in the command above (e.g. 10).
